#Learning Tuples in Python

#Declaration of strings using sets
me = ("Tafadzwa", "Alexander")
her = ("Tinotenda", "Wendy")
my_age = 28
her_age = 27

#Declaration of my first dictionary
us = {me:my_age, her:her_age}

#Declaration of my Tuple
my_first_tuple = (her, me)

#Printing out my first Tuple in my terminal
print(my_first_tuple)

#Printing out my first dictionary
print(us)

#I am also paying attention to the correct indentation
